var coverContent = "<h1>Welcome to CartoCV - v2!</h1><p>Welcome to view my CV mapped out! Creating this CV map was a quick project I did when starting my cartography studies to learn some basic web mapping. The content has been updated every now and then, but now the original code has been improved, and the javascript plugins have been updated.</p><p>The features on the map show the locations of my education, work experience and other projects I've been involved in. Clicking an item in the map will give you more detailed information. The sidebar panel you are reading shows information like an ordinary CV would. There are tabs for<br> <i class='fa fa-user'></i>	<b>personal information</b>, <br><i class='fa fa-graduation-cap'></i> 	<b>education</b>, <br><i class='fa fa-cogs'></i> 	<b>work experience</b>, <br><i class='fa fa-globe'> </i>	<b>projects and other activities</b>, and <br> <i class='fa fa-book'></i>	<b>Publications</b> <br> Unfortunately, due to difficulty in specifying a location, not all items included in the tabs are shown on map. </p> <p><b>Short introduction</b><br><br>I am a DSc student working at Aalto University, Helsinki. In my research, I develop methods to identify communities which are impacted by water scarcity. The research is multidisciplinary combining geoinformatics, socio-economics and natural sciences. </p><p><b>My professional interests</b><br>▪	water resources management,<br>▪	sustainability,<br>▪	GIS and cartography, <br>▪	Open Data and Open Science<br>▪	information visualization (especially environmental information), and <br>▪	Humanitarianism.<br><p>If you have any suggestions or comments about the map, or proposals for collaboration, feel free to contact!.</p><p>Marko Kallio<br>marko@markokallio.fi";
