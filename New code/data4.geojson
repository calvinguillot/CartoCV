During the trip we also harboured in Helsingor (Denmark), Stavanger and Maloy (Norway). The crew consisted of participants from all over the Baltic Sea region and were from a varied background.   The course itself offered a wide perspective on sustainability issues in the countries of the Baltic Sea and more importantly, the prespective from professionals from different fields than mine.  At the end of the course i was invited for a Watch Leader training in summers of 2014 and 2015 for showing leadership and setting an example during the SAIL.",

The study site was located in the Eastern Scheldt in Ouwerkerk. Assignment included designing and implementing the experiment. We studied different materials commonly used to build dykes; concrete, limestone, granite and basalt.  Results suggest that the best material to build dykes (in these conditions and in terms of biological productivity) is limestone thanks to the porous surface. Limestone is slowly dissolved creating pores (and surface area) and ecological niches that are not present in other materials.",
